 /* Description: this is week 4 assignment. this assignment will require to enter a number a salesmen, sales and prompt how much
  *              it differs from the highest sales earner. The application will work with week3 assignment. It will ask the user
 /* 			 to input the sales, and it will require the user to reach the 80% of the targeted sales which is 100,000
 /*				 and then it will calculate the 3%. Another aspect, it will increase 1.5% additional to the 3%. This will be  
 /*				 displayed. Then at the end, should also display a table of potential total annual compensation that the user
 /* 			 could have earned, in $5000 increments above the user's annual sales, until it reaches 50% above the user's 
 /* 			 annual sales.
